# Greeps
A Code for the Greenfoot Greeps Competition.
This Code is required to be run in the Greenfoot Application. 
This code has 3 practice maps that you can practice on.

THE RULES ARE:


Rule 1: Only change the class 'Greep'. No other classes may be modified or created.

Rule 2: No additional fields. You cannot extend the Greeps' memory. That is: You are not allowed to add fields to the class (except final fields). You can use the one byte memory that is provided.

Rule 3: You cannot move more than once per 'act' round.

Rule 4: You cannot communicate directly with other Greeps. That is: no field accesses or method calls to other Greep objects are allowed. (Greeps can communicate indirectly via the paint spots on the ground.)

Rule 5: No long vision. You are allowed to look at the world only at the immediate location of the Greep. Greeps are almost blind, and cannot look any further.

Rule 6: No creation of objects. You are not allowed to create any scenario objects (instances of user-defined classes, such as Greep or Paint). Greeps have no magic powers - they cannot create things out of nothing.

Rule 7: No teleporting. Methods from Actor that cheat normal movement (such as setLocation) may not be used.
